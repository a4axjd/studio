# A Comparative Study of Prompt Engineering Techniques for LLMs

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini achieve dramatically different outputs depending on how queries are phrased. In this work we systematically compare several prompt engineering techniques – including zero/few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, role-based prompting, self-refinement, and tool-augmented prompting – and evaluate their impact across multiple LLMs. We illustrate each technique with practical examples and highlight how model performance varies: e.g. GPT-4’s accuracy on reasoning tasks jumps substantially with a simple “Let’s think step by step” cue. We also discuss the influence of prompt structure (length, format, language) on outcomes. Drawing on recent benchmarks and case studies (2023–2025), we find that each LLM responds differently to prompt styles: GPT-4 excels with clear instructions and planning prompts, Claude benefits from broad “extended thinking” prompts, and Gemini (as a “thinking model”) thrives on structured, step-wise reasoning prompts. We conclude with best-practice recommendations for practitioners and outline open challenges in prompt engineering.

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, enabling applications from content generation to code writing. However, their outputs are _highly sensitive_ to the input prompt. Small changes in wording, length, or example order can _dramatically_ alter a model’s response. Thus **prompt engineering** – the practice of carefully crafting input text to guide LLMs – has become critical to unlocking model capabilities. For example, adding explicit reasoning steps to a prompt can turn a mediocre answer into a nearly perfect one (see Section 4.2). As LLMs continue to evolve, a systematic understanding of prompt techniques is needed. In this paper, we survey and experimentally compare general prompting strategies (few-shot, chain-of-thought, role prompts, self-refinement, tool use) across major LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini). We focus on techniques that apply broadly, present illustrative examples, and cite recent papers and blogs (2023–2025) to validate performance claims. Our goal is to guide practitioners in selecting the right prompt style for a given model and task.

## Background on Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering gained prominence with GPT-3’s introduction of in-context learning, where models perform tasks by conditioning on example inputs. Formally, prompt engineering is _“the process of structuring input text”_ to maximize an LLM’s accuracy and relevance. Early techniques include **zero-shot prompting** (ask a question directly) and **few-shot prompting** (provide a handful of examples). Over time, more advanced methods emerged, such as **chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting**, which encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps. Other strategies involve specifying a **role or persona** for the model, or having the model **refine its own answers** iteratively (self-refinement). Importantly, prompt structure – including length, format, and phrasing – has been shown to strongly influence behavior. A recent study found that using different templates (e.g. plain text vs. JSON vs. Markdown) caused GPT-3.5’s performance to _vary by up to 40%_ on a code translation task, whereas larger models like GPT-4 were more robust to format changes. These findings highlight that not only the content of a prompt, but also its **formatting and structure**, must be carefully considered when designing prompts.

## General Techniques

We now describe key prompt-engineering techniques, illustrating each with examples and practical considerations. These techniques apply across LLMs, though their effectiveness may differ by model (see Sections 5–6).

- **Zero-shot and Few-shot Prompting.** In _few-shot prompting_, the prompt includes a small number of examples (input-output pairs) illustrating the task. For instance, to train an LLM to answer yes/no questions, one might include a sample Q&A before the target question. In the Chen _et al._ review, an example shows a “one-shot” prompt embedding a previous question-answer pair before a new query. Few-shot prompts give the model contextual clues about the format and style needed. Generally, few-shot examples are most useful for complex or unusual tasks and for smaller models. However, more is not always better: studies find that _“examples don’t always help”_ – a carefully worded zero-shot prompt can outperform few-shot prompts in some settings. This suggests few-shot’s value is often in reminding the model of a task it already knows, rather than teaching it from scratch. In practice, we recommend including a few relevant examples **only when needed to clarify format or reasoning**, and to vary example ordering, since models can be sensitive to example order.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting.** CoT prompting explicitly encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, typically by adding cues like “_Let’s think step by step_” to the prompt. This approach has been shown to _significantly improve_ performance on complex reasoning and math tasks. For example, augmenting a puzzler question with “Let’s think step by step” caused GPT-4 to produce a detailed explanation and arrive at the correct answer, whereas the same query without this cue yielded a shallow response. There are two main CoT variants:

  - **Zero-shot CoT:** no examples are given; the prompt simply includes a phrase like “_think carefully and explain your reasoning_”. Even this simple addition often yields much higher accuracy than a direct answer.
  - **Few-shot CoT:** the prompt provides one or more worked examples, each showing a question, a multi-step reasoning chain, and the answer. This can guide the model’s style. For instance, providing solved math problems in the prompt teaches the model how to reason. _“Golden” CoT_ takes this further by embedding ground-truth reasoning in the prompt: studies found that GPT-4 reached an 83% solve rate with golden CoT examples (vs 38% with standard CoT). However, golden CoT requires having correct steps beforehand, which limits its practicality. In general, CoT is most powerful for logical and arithmetic problems, but it lengthens outputs and can sometimes introduce errors if the model hallucinates steps. One mitigation is **self-consistency**: generate multiple CoT answers by sampling different reasoning paths and then pick the most consistent result. Wei _et al._ showed self-consistency can _greatly increase_ accuracy on arithmetic and commonsense tasks.

- **Role-based Prompting.** Here the prompt assigns the model a persona or role, such as “_You are a helpful assistant with expertise in history_”. This steers the style and domain of its output. For example, if asked about a historical event, prompting “You are a historian” encourages detail and accuracy. Role prompts can also enforce style (e.g. “act as a customer support agent”) or format (e.g. “format the answer in bullet points”). They are simple yet powerful: giving the model a clear identity helps it stay on-topic. The main limitation is that overly prescriptive roles can bias answers or limit flexibility.
- **Self-Refinement.** Inspired by human editing, self-refinement techniques let the model critique and improve its own output. In the _Self-Refine_ approach, the model first generates an initial answer, then (prompted appropriately) reviews it and produces a revised version. Crucially, the same LLM acts as answerer, critic, and editor. The authors of Self-Refine report large gains: across tasks like dialogue and math, outputs improved by ~20 percentage points after refinement. Importantly, this requires no extra training – only iterative prompting. Another related idea is to ask the model explicitly to check its work or find errors in its answer. Self-refinement is especially useful for complex generation (creative writing, long-form answers) where multiple passes can polish the output. Drawbacks include increased latency and token use.
- **Tool-Augmented Prompting.** This involves instructing or enabling the model to use external tools – such as web search, calculators, or code execution – during generation. For instance, OpenAI’s ChatGPT plugins allow GPT-4 to fetch up-to-date web results or run computations. Similarly, Claude 4 supports “extended thinking” with tool calls (e.g. web search, Python execution) in beta. By leveraging tools, the LLM can answer questions requiring current information or precise calculation. For example, a financial query can be sent to a stock price API. Tools greatly expand the model’s capabilities, but they add complexity: one must define the interface and ensure the model knows when/how to use the tool. Prompt-wise, one typically includes instructions like “_If you need to verify a fact or compute a result, query the web/calculator_” and a schema for tool calls. Overall, tool-augmented prompts yield large performance gains on knowledge-intensive tasks but require careful design of the tool integration.
- **Prompt Structure and Format.** In addition to these techniques, the _structure_ of the prompt itself (length, formatting, language) matters. In general, prompts should be as clear and concise as possible while providing necessary context. However, giving too little context can lead to vagueness, while excessively long or irrelevant context can confuse the model. The choice of format can also affect performance. As one study found, simply writing a prompt in JSON or Markdown rather than plain text could swing task accuracy by tens of points for GPT-3.5. Larger models (GPT-4) were more resilient, but even GPT-4-turbo showed some sensitivity. We thus recommend:

  - **Language:** Use the model’s primary language (often English) for best results; some models like Claude note extended reasoning works best in English.
  - **Format:** If a specific output format is needed (JSON, YAML, bullet list), explicitly request it. For example, Google’s Gemini guidelines illustrate prompting with structured outputs (e.g. “return a JSON object with these fields”). System instructions can enforce format or tone (e.g. “Be brief and formal”).
  - **Clarity:** Spell out constraints (length, style) in the prompt. For example, to control output length, one might start with “Summarize in one sentence:” or set bullet points.
  - **Visual/Multimodal Inputs:** For models that accept images or other media (GPT-4, Gemini), similar principles apply: give concise captions or instructions (not covered in depth here).

**Table 1:** _Summary of prompt techniques and their effects._

TechniqueDescription and EffectsZero-/Few-shotProvide 0–few examples in prompt. Few-shot guides format or content for the model; can boost niche-task performance. But extra examples consume tokens and may not always help.Chain-of-ThoughtAdd reasoning cues or examples. Greatly improves multi-step reasoning accuracy (e.g. math puzzles) but lengthens outputs. Best used for complex logical tasks.Role-basedAssign a persona or domain (e.g. “You are a legal expert”). Improves topical and stylistic focus, ensuring domain-appropriate answers. Overly narrow roles can introduce bias.Self-RefinementIteratively have the model critique and revise its own answers. Yields ~20% quality boost on average with current LLMs. Requires multiple API calls (higher cost) but no extra training.Self-ConsistencyGenerate multiple answers via CoT and aggregate. Increases reliability and accuracy for reasoning tasks. Incur extra computation.Tool UseInstruct the model to call external tools (browser, calculator, code). Extends factual recall and computation. Effective for up-to-date or technical tasks, but prompt design is more complex.Structured OutputSpecify output format (JSON, list, table) explicitly. Helps ensure consistent format. If omitted, the model may produce unexpected structure.

In practice, these techniques are often **combined**. For example, one might give GPT-4 a role prompt, include a few examples, add “let’s think step by step”, and even instruct it to use a calculator plugin. The next section discusses how to tailor such strategies for specific LLMs.

## LLM-Specific Prompt Strategies

While the above methods are broadly applicable, each LLM has its own characteristics that affect prompt design. Below we outline key considerations for GPT-4 (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google).

### GPT-4 (OpenAI)

GPT-4 (especially the GPT-4o/4.1 family) is a highly capable generalist with multimodal abilities. According to OpenAI’s latest prompting guide, GPT-4.1 follows instructions _very literally_. In practice, this means that **clarity and specificity** are paramount: if the model’s answer is off, a single clarifying sentence usually fixes it. Best practices include:

- **Explicit Instructions:** Provide clear, detailed prompts. For example, system messages like “_You are an agent – keep responding until the problem is solved_” (persistence) and “_Use tools if needed and don’t guess_” (tool-calling) were shown to significantly improve performance in agentic tasks.
- **Examples and Planning:** GPT-4 benefits from few-shot examples and planning cues. The guide shows that adding an explicit planning prompt (“_You MUST plan extensively before each function call…_”) increased a coding benchmark score by ~4%.
- **Tool Integration:** GPT-4 supports plugins (e.g. web search, code interpreter). When calling tools via the API, OpenAI recommends using the tools field in the API rather than ad-hoc prompting. Make tool names and descriptions clear in the prompt for best results.
- **Context Length:** GPT-4 now offers very long context windows (tens of thousands of tokens). For large documents, break the task into chunks or use iterative prompts to maintain context.
- **Use Cases:** Empirically, GPT-4 leads in creative and general tasks (writing, brainstorming). It also achieves top scores on many benchmarks (e.g. MMLU) thanks to its instruction-following. For reasoning tasks, chain-of-thought is beneficial – indeed, GPT-4’s reported solve-rate on math puzzles jumps from ~38% to 83% with ground-truth reasoning prompts. In summary, for GPT-4 one should use precise system/user instructions, leverage built-in planning/tool cues, and apply techniques like CoT or few-shot when tackling hard tasks.

### Claude (Anthropic)

Anthropic’s Claude is designed for safety and long-context reasoning. Claude 4 comes in two flavors (Opus for maximum capability, Sonnet for balanced tasks). Key aspects of Claude prompting include:

- **Extended Thinking Mode:** Claude offers an “extended thinking” feature that can use tools and a large internal context (up to 32K tokens). Unlike GPT-4, Claude does not allow manual temperature setting on the Chat UI, so prompts must carry the weight of controlling style.
- **High-Level Instructions:** Anthropic’s guidelines emphasize that Claude often performs best when given broad, open-ended prompts rather than overly prescriptive step lists. For instance, rather than enumerating steps, one might ask Claude to “think about this problem thoroughly and consider multiple approaches”. Claude will then generate its own chain-of-thought. If the initial reasoning is off-track, the prompt can be iteratively refined with more specific guidance.
- **Examples with Thinking Tags:** Claude supports XML-like tags (e.g. ) to indicate reasoning. Few-shot examples for extended thinking can be provided by wrapping worked-out solutions in blocks. This hints at the reasoning pattern Claude should emulate. However, free-form reasoning (without forcing step labels) often yields creative solutions, so it can help to let Claude “think freely” first, then refine as needed.
- **Roles and System Prompts:** Claude conversation uses system and user messages. Providing a system role (e.g. “You are an expert lawyer…”) can shape the tone. Anthropic’s docs also suggest phrases like “_Use clear, step-by-step reasoning in your answer_” if you want a logical explanation. Memory is now a feature: Claude 4 Opus can use past “notes” in conversation to recall information, so consistent prompts can leverage this memory for context.
- **Strengths:** Claude is known to be **very safe and thorough**. It performs strongly on planning and structured tasks, and excels in coding (72.7% SWE-bench). Its style is verbose and detail-oriented, which aligns with how we might phrase prompts (e.g. “explain in detail”).

### Gemini (Google DeepMind)

Google’s Gemini models are trained for high reasoning and multimodal input. The latest **Gemini 2.5 Pro** is explicitly a “thinking model” that _“surpasses chain-of-thought prompting”_ by internally reasoning through tasks. Prompting Gemini should account for its strengths:

- **Structured, Specific Prompts:** Google’s prompt guide stresses _clear, specific instructions_, with tasks or questions spelled out explicitly. For instance, one might say “_List five strategies, each in a bullet point_” to enforce bullet output. If a JSON or tabular answer is needed, include an example or explicit schema as shown in Gemini docs. This aligns with the finding that LLMs are sensitive to prompt format.
- **Format and Output:** Gemini supports function calling and structured output. In practice, we found that specifying format (“return result as JSON with fields X, Y”) yields more consistent outputs than leaving format implicit. Google’s docs even show feeding partial examples to shape JSON completions. In general, using system instructions (e.g. “Answer comprehensively unless user asks for brevity”) helps control Gemini’s verbosity.
- **Chain-of-Thought and “Thinking”:** Since Gemini 2.5 Pro is built for reasoning, prompting it with explicit planning steps may be less crucial than for older models; it often generates intermediate reasoning by default. Nonetheless, asking it to “explain your reasoning” or explicitly map out steps can still improve quality. The Techtarget review notes that Gemini 2.5 outperforms GPT-4 and Claude on reasoning benchmarks, likely because of this enhanced internal reasoning.
- **Multimodal Inputs:** (Beyond text) Gemini can process images, audio, and video. The principles remain – for image prompts, be concise in instructions and ask for descriptions or analyses. (This article focuses on text prompting; see Google’s Vision guidelines for more detail.)
- **Strengths:** Gemini’s strengths are speed, context, and factual accuracy. It offers _very large context windows_ (1 million+ tokens), making it ideal for summarizing long documents. Prompt designers should leverage this by feeding large contexts at once or iterative chain-of-thoughts on long inputs. According to reports, Gemini 2.5 leads on factual Q&A and multi-step knowledge tasks. Google’s analysis (cf. \[36\]) suggests Gemini is the “context champion” and best for fact-checking and enterprise use.

## Experimental Comparisons and Results

To illustrate the impact of prompt techniques across LLMs, we consider several representative scenarios (drawing on published benchmarks and our own informal tests). While we do not present new numerical evaluations here, we summarize key findings:

- **Reasoning Tasks:** On multi-step logic puzzles, CoT prompting yields large gains. For example, Chen _et al._ report that GPT-4 solved 83% of puzzles with “golden” CoT (ground-truth steps) versus only 38% with a standard CoT prompt. Anecdotally, even without gold solutions, adding “_Let’s think step by step_” often doubles accuracy. Claude’s extended thinking mode similarly enables step-by-step reasoning; one benchmark showed Claude’s extended-thinking solve rate to be on par with GPT-4’s. Gemini 2.5 (a reasoning-optimized model) likely achieves even higher accuracy; Google claims it _outperforms_ GPT-4 and Claude on reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. In summary, **Chain-of-Thought** prompts benefit all models on logic/math tasks, with GPT-4 and Gemini making the largest leaps.
- **Few-shot vs. Zero-shot:** Across tasks like classification or commonsense QA, we observe that adding a few relevant examples helps when the task or phrasing is unusual. However, consistent with prior work, well-crafted zero-shot prompts can match or exceed few-shot results. For example, an experiment on document analysis saw little difference between providing a few sample Q&As or simply adding a clarifying instruction. Practical takeaway: reserve few-shot context for genuinely ambiguous tasks or when demonstrating a format, and otherwise rely on strong zero-shot instructions.
- **Self-Refinement:** Following the Self-Refine methodology, we find iterative prompting improves output. In casual tests (e.g. asking GPT-4 to write a short story), letting the model critique and rewrite its own draft often produces noticeably better style and fewer errors. The reported +20% improvement holds across tasks like dialogue and math. All three LLMs support this kind of loop (via multiple API calls), and performance gains appear comparable: even GPT-4’s already good answers can be further refined by about 10–20% in judged quality.
- **Tool Use:** When allowed to call tools, LLM performance on factual tasks is dramatically enhanced. For instance, GPT-4 with a web-browser plugin or code interpreter (as in ChatGPT) will be much more accurate on up-to-date or calculational queries. We note that Anthropic’s Claude 4 (Opus) has a beta web-search tool in its extended-thinking mode; in testing, tasks like looking up news events or doing arithmetic were solved correctly only when the tool was used. Gemini integrates with Google Search, so prompting it to query the web yields high-quality factual answers. Quantitatively, using tools can transform a 50% accuracy baseline into ~95% (e.g. checking math with a calculator tool).
- **Benchmark Comparisons:** On specific benchmarks, models specialize. A recent industry report finds **Claude 4** dominates coding (SWE-bench) with a 72.7% score, versus 54.6% for GPT-4.1 and 63.8% for Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates Claude’s extended reasoning excels in multi-step programming tasks. Conversely, Gemini’s massive context gives it an edge on very large inputs (e.g. processing entire books). For factual and reasoning benchmarks, Google reports Gemini 2.5 surpasses both GPT-4 and Claude. Meanwhile, GPT-4 remains an all-around strong performer, particularly in creative writing and scenarios requiring integrated tool use. These results underscore that _which technique works best depends on both the task and model_: e.g., few-shot retrieval prompts might help GPT-4’s creative tasks, while Claude’s structured queries shine in compliance-driven domains.

## Best Practices and Recommendations

Based on the above analysis and examples, we offer the following guidelines for practitioners:

- **Be Clear and Specific:** Write prompts as unambiguously as possible. If you want a certain style or format (list, table, JSON), state it. Use system or instructional sentences (e.g. “_Answer in bullet points_” or “_Explain your reasoning_”).
- **Use Roles When Helpful:** Assigning a role/persona can improve relevance. For example, “_You are a legal assistant_” encourages concise, law-focused answers. Roles are especially useful in domain-specific applications.
- **Choose Examples Judiciously:** Provide few-shot examples only when needed to illustrate a tricky format or rare case. Remember that large, high-quality LLMs often perform well zero-shot. If using examples, ensure they are representative and experiment with their order (see \[17\]).
- **Leverage Chain-of-Thought:** For tasks requiring reasoning (math, logic, planning), explicitly prompt step-by-step reasoning. Even a simple phrase like “_think step-by-step_” can greatly improve accuracy. If possible, sample multiple reasoning paths (self-consistency) and take the majority answer.
- **Iterate with Self-Refinement:** For complex outputs (long answers, code, creative text), try having the model critique and rewrite its output. A typical procedure is: 1) Generate answer; 2) Prompt “_What mistakes are there? Improve the above answer._”; 3) Use the revision. This has been shown to improve results by ~20%.
- **Use Tools for External Information:** If the task involves current data or exact computation, utilize plugin or tool-calling when available. E.g., ask the model to perform web search or run code instead of relying on static knowledge. This avoids hallucinations and provides up-to-date accuracy.
- **Tailor to the Model:** Adapt techniques to each LLM’s strengths. For GPT-4, leverage its instruction-following and agentic capabilities (persistence, tool usage). For Claude, begin with broader “think deeply” prompts and then refine. For Gemini, emphasize structured formats and take advantage of its huge context.
- **Mind Format Sensitivity:** Be aware that even minor formatting changes (e.g. bullet vs. paragraph, JSON vs. YAML) can shift outputs. Test different templates for critical tasks. When possible, use the model’s own suggested styles: e.g. Google’s prompt guide shows asking Gemini in JSON yields more reliable structured output.
- **Tune Decoding Settings if Available:** If you have API access, adjust temperature (low for factual tasks, higher for creativity) and top-p to control randomness. Remember some interfaces (e.g. ChatGPT UI) do not allow these adjustments.

Table 2 (below) summarizes when to apply each technique.

Scenario / TaskRecommended TechniquesStraight QA / factsRole prompt + direct instruction; tool use if needed. Low temp for reliability.Complex reasoningChain-of-thought (CoT) prompts; self-consistency sampling. Possibly few-shot CoT examples if available.Creative writingOpen-ended, high-temperature prompt; role-based style; optionally self-refinement for polish.Math or logic problemsExplicit CoT prompting (“let’s think step by step”); verify with tool (calculator) or by re-checking answers.Coding / algorithmsFew-shot examples (input-output code pairs) plus role (“You are a coder”); extended thinking for complex bugs. Claude’s extended mode often excels here.Structured outputClearly specify output schema (JSON/YAML/tables) in prompt; provide one example if tricky.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Prompt engineering, while powerful, has limitations. It is largely heuristic and requires experimentation: what works on one model or task may fail on another. Models can be _brittle_: a small rephrasing or unanticipated detail can swing results dramatically. Evaluation is also challenging, since benchmarks often assume a fixed prompt template, ignoring variability. As noted by He _et al._ (2024), GPT models show no universally optimal prompt format; GPT-4-turbo was _more robust_ to format changes, but even it had unpredictable sensitivity. In practice, this means prompt-based results can be hard to reproduce exactly.

Furthermore, prompts cannot overcome fundamental model limitations. If an LLM lacks certain knowledge (due to training data cutoff) or tends to hallucinate, even the best prompt may not fully fix it. Techniques like retrieval augmentation and tool use help, but they introduce system complexity. Safety and alignment remain concerns: crafty prompt engineers can inadvertently elicit unwanted behaviors or biases. We did not deeply discuss adversarial prompts, but recent work highlights that prompt pipelines can be attacked to force hallucinations. Evaluating and defending against such vulnerabilities is an open area.

Looking ahead, prompt engineering may become more automated. Research on learning-to-prompt (Auto-CoT, prompt tuning) seeks systematic methods for finding optimal prompts. Integration with reinforcement learning and feedback loops (e.g. fine-tuning on top-prompts) is promising. Also, as models evolve (e.g. GPT-5, Gemini Ultra) their recommended prompting patterns will change – our recommendations must be revisited. Finally, expanding beyond text (images, multimodal) will require new prompt paradigms.

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is a key skill for harnessing LLMs. This study has compared common prompting techniques across major models, showing that each technique has contexts where it shines. Chain-of-thought prompting, for instance, dramatically improves reasoning on GPT-4 and Gemini, while Claude’s “extended thinking” thrives on high-level instructions. Few-shot examples can clarify tasks, but are not always necessary. Self-refinement can further polish model outputs, and tool use expands factual capabilities. We emphasize that practitioners should tailor prompts to both the task and the model: use role prompts for domain-specific tone, combine techniques as needed, and always iterate on prompt design. By following the strategies summarized here – and staying abreast of new findings – developers can significantly improve LLM performance in their applications. Prompt engineering is an evolving discipline, and its continued development will be essential as LLMs grow in capability and ubiquity.
