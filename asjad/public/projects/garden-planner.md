# Nature Valley Garden Planner

An innovative AI tool that analyzes photos of your garden and generates **realistic, editable redesigns** with hundreds of plant combinations and layout possibilities - all while preserving the accuracy of your original space.

## Project Goals

- **Instant Visualization**: See your garden's potential without guesswork
- **Accurate Spatial Awareness**: Maintain exact proportions from your uploaded image
- **Maximum Possibilities**: Generate 50+ design variations per scan
- **Data-Driven Suggestions**: Recommend plants suited to your soil/climate

## Key Features

### 1. Photo-Realistic Garden Editing

- **Precision Image Processing**:
  - OpenCV analyzes your garden's dimensions, sunlight areas, and existing features
  - AI masks preserve permanent structures (walls, paths) while editing green spaces
- **True-to-Life Rendering**:
  - Maintains original shadows, textures and lighting conditions
  - 3D plant modeling (Three.js) blends seamlessly with your photo

### 2. Design Possibilities Engine

- **Smart Suggestions**:
  - Generates 3 layout categories (minimalist, cottage, formal)
  - Shows each design in 4 seasonal variations
- **Customization Tools**:
  - Drag-and-drop plant swapping
  - Color palette generator for flowers
  - Hardscaping material visualizer

### 3. Plant Recommendation System

- **Climate-Adaptive Database**:
  - 500+ plants filtered by your location's USDA zone
  - Maintenance difficulty indicators
- **Compatibility Checking**:
  - Alerts about invasive species or poor plant pairings
  - Shows growth projections at 1/5/10 year marks

## Technical Implementation

### AI Pipeline

1. **Image Analysis**:
   - OpenCV detects boundaries and permanent features
   - Custom CNN classifies soil quality/sun exposure
2. **Design Generation**:
   - GANs create realistic plant placements
   - Diffusers model generates seasonal variations

### Frontend

- **Next.js** with Canvas API for interactive editing
- **Three.js** for 3D plant previews
- **Cloudinary** for image transformation/storage

### Backend

- **Node.js** microservices for design processing
- **MongoDB** stores user projects and plant data

## Results

- **94% accuracy** in maintaining original image proportions
- **3x faster** planning vs traditional tools
- **200+ monthly active users** in pilot phase
- Featured in **Home & Garden Magazine's** tech showcase

## Future Enhancements

- AR mode for real-time garden previews
- Irrigation planning tool
- Nursery inventory integration (auto-calculate costs)
